      <item value="Called whenever the widget configuration changes. If the parent widget rebuilds and requests that this location in the tree update to display a new widget with the same [runtimeType] and [Widget.key], the framework will update the [widget] property of this [State] object to refer to the new widget and then call this method with the previous widget as an argument. Override this method to respond when the [widget] changes (e.g., to start implicit animations). The framework always calls [build] after calling [didUpdateWidget], which means any calls to [setState] in [didUpdateWidget] are redundant. {@macro flutter.widgets.State.initState} Implementations of this method should start with a call to the inherited method, as in `super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget)`. _See the discussion at [Element.rebuild] for more information on when this method is called._" />

The underlying implementation is designed to avoid all allocations on insertion, removal, retrieval, and iteration.

In addition, this implementation minimizes memory usage by avoiding the use of separate objects to hold keyvalue pairs." />

When `room.schemaLocation` is set, Room will check this variable and if it is set to `true`, the database schema will be exported into the given folder.
