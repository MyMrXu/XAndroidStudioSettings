Shifting down by {@link ACTION_POINTER_INDEX_SHIFT} provides the actual pointer index where the data for the pointer going up or down can be found; you can get its identifier with {@link getPointerId(int)} and the actual data with {@link getX(int)} etc." />

      <item value="A normalized value that describes the approximate size of the pointer touch area in relation to the maximum detectable size of the device. It represents some approximation of the area of the screen being pressed; the actual value in pixels corresponding to the touch is normalized with the device specific range of values and scaled to a value between 0 and 1. The value of size can be used to determine fat touch events." />
      <item value="A normalized value that describes the pressure applied to the device by a finger or other tool. The pressure generally ranges from 0 (no pressure at all) to 1 (normal pressure), although values higher than 1 may be generated depending on the calibration of the input device." />

In the extreme case, a virtual machine that has no stack trace information concerning this throwable is permitted to return a zero-length array from this method. Generally speaking, the array returned by this method will contain one element for every frame that would be printed by {@code printStackTrace}. Writes to the returned array do not affect future calls to this method." />
      <item value="Provides programmatic access to the stack trace information printed by {@link printStackTrace()}. Returns an array of stack trace elements, each representing one stack frame. The zeroth element of the array (assuming the array's length is non-zero) represents the top of the stack, which is the last method invocation in the sequence. Typically, this is the point at which this throwable was created and thrown. The last element of the array (assuming the array's length is non-zero) represents the bottom of the stack, which is the first method invocation in the sequence." />
